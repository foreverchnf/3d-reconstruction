# 3d-face-reconstruction
## Environmentï¼šwindows 10
## python: 3.8.5

This 3D reconstruction process is implemented with face3d(github) and dlib-19.20.0(python)

### 1.Fetch and install face3d
#### 1.1 download the code from [face3d](https://github.com/YadiraF/face3d)
#### 1.2 Prepare BFM data  [Data/BFM/readme.md](https://github.com/YadiraF/face3d/blob/master/examples/Data/BFM/readme.md) according to the instruction
#### 1.3 Follow the Readme to install and run some examples

### 2.Install dilb
#### 2.1 download the code from http://dlib.net/
#### 2.2 Use command line in the folder path to install
```python 
python setup.py install
```
#### 2.3 To use landmark detection function, we need to download [shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat](http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2)
#### 2.4 Run python_examples 

### 3.3D reconstruction with dlib and face3d
run the code my_project.py with command
```python
python my_project_demo.py [faces_folder_path] [result_folder_path]
```
It will automatically handle all photos in the [faces_folder_path] and make re-rendered 3d face for every detected faces, then save them in [result_folder_path].

### 4.Make Caricature photo
#### 4.1 Create some deformation face model as in [deformation](https://github.com/foreverchnf/3d-reconstruction/tree/master/deformation) folder
#### 4.2 run the code demo_1.py with command
```python
python demo_1.py [faces_folder_path] [result_folder_path] [objFilePath]
```
It will acheive the same function as in 3 but also use the deformation model in [objFilePath] to make Caricature photos of the original faces
